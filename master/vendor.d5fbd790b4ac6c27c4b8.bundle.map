It either throws an error or, if\n\t * the dependency was\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n\t * location, and others.\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n\t *\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n\t * depth-first order. The\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n\t *\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n\t *\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n\t * delegate to the parent\n\t * injector.\n\t *\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n\t * element and the\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n\t * directives.\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n\t * child directives.\n\t *\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n\t * practice.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n\t *       </div>\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   </div>\n\t * </div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Injectable()\n\t * class SomeService {\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\n\t *   inputs: [\n\t *     'id: dependency'\n\t *   ]\n\t * })\n\t * class Dependency {\n\t *   id:string;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### No injection\n\t *\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n\t * `MyDirective`.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor() {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Component-level injection\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n\t * parents.\n\t *\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n\t * from the parent\n\t * component's injector.\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n\t * have returned\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n\t * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n\t *\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n\t * elements.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n\t *\n\t * ### Optional injection\n\t *\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n\t * resolved. If you\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n\t * optional.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n\t * If none can be\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n\t *   inputs: [\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\n\t *   ],\n\t *   host: {\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n\t *   }\n\t * })\n\t * class Tooltip{\n\t *   text:string;\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n\t *\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\n\t * like so:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n\t * elements:\n\t *\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n\t * runtime.\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n\t * location in the current view\n\t * where these actions are performed.\n\t *\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n\t *\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n\t * equivalent.\n\t *\n\t * Thus,\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Expands in use to:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n\t *   </template>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n\t * the directive\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n\t *\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\n\t *\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\n\t * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n\t *\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\n\t * })\n\t * export class Unless {\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\n\t *\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n\t * and the result is:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n\t *     <li></li>\n\t *   </template>\n\t *   <li></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n\t * the instantiated\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n\t * @ts2dart_const\n\t */\n\tvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\n\t    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\n\t    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\n\t        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.\n\t/**\n\t * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.\n\t *\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.\n\t *\n\t * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the\n\t * directive's `selector` matches\n\t * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n\t *\n\t * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n\t * arguments.\n\t * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n\t * depth-first order,\n\t *    as declared in the HTML.\n\t *\n\t * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n\t *\n\t * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n\t * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n\t *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n\t * the dependency was\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n\t * location, and others.\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n\t *\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n\t * depth-first order. The\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n\t *\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n\t *\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n\t * delegate to the parent\n\t * injector.\n\t *\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n\t * element and the\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n\t * directives.\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n\t * child directives.\n\t *\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n\t * practice.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n\t *       </div>\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   </div>\n\t * </div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Injectable()\n\t * class SomeService {\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\n\t *   inputs: [\n\t *     'id: dependency'\n\t *   ]\n\t * })\n\t * class Dependency {\n\t *   id:string;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### No injection\n\t *\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n\t * `MyDirective`.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor() {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Component-level injection\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n\t * parents.\n\t *\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n\t * from the parent\n\t * component's injector.\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n\t *\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n\t * have returned\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n\t * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n\t *\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n\t *\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n\t * elements.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n\t *\n\t * ### Optional injection\n\t *\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n\t * resolved. If you\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n\t * optional.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n\t * class MyDirective {\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n\t * If none can be\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n\t *   inputs: [\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\n\t *   ],\n\t *   host: {\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n\t *   }\n\t * })\n\t * class Tooltip{\n\t *   text:string;\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n\t *\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\n\t * like so:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n\t * elements:\n\t *\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n\t * runtime.\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n\t * location in the current view\n\t * where these actions are performed.\n\t *\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n\t *\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n\t * equivalent.\n\t *\n\t * Thus,\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Expands in use to:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n\t *   </template>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n\t * the directive\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n\t *\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\n\t *\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\n\t * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example\n\t *\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n\t *\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @Directive({\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\n\t * })\n\t * export class Unless {\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\n\t *\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n\t * and the result is:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * <ul>\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n\t *     <li></li>\n\t *   </template>\n\t *   <li></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n\t * the instantiated\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n\t */\n\texports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\n\t// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\n * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n * @ts2dart_const\n */\nexport class

When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\n * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n */\nexport var Directive: DirectiveMetadataFactory =\n    <DirectiveMetadataFactory>makeDecorator(DirectiveMetadata);\n\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.
